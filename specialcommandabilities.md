ADJUSTING fIRE
The artillery in this Force are experts in coordinating fire against
targets . If two artillery units in a Force with this SCA are firing at the
same target (unit or POI), the second and successive units receive the
successive shots fired at this target modifier (–2) . The successive shots
fired modifier can only apply once per turn, though it is cumulative
over multiple turns .
ANTI-AIRCRAfT SPECIALISTS
A force that possesses the Anti-Aircraft Specialists special
command ability has honed its skills specifically to counter the
threat of airborne opponents . Like Sharp Shooters and Brawlers, it
is uncommon for a whole force to possess this ability, so players are
advised to limit this capability to a pre-determined portion of their
deployed forces .
Anti-Aircraft Specialists apply a –2 Target Number modifier
to all attacks made against an airborne target, including ground
vehicles with a VTOL (v) or WiGE (g) movement type, aerospace and
conventional fighters, Small Craft, DropShips, and so forth . Against
all other ground-based units (including those that use jumping
movement), or airborne-capable units that are grounded at the
time of the attack, this Target Number modifier becomes +1 instead .
Aerospace units may not make use of the Anti-Aircraft
Specialists command ability .
ANTI-‘MECH TRAINING
Infantry units in this force receive a –1 Target Number modifier
on anti-‘Mech attacks .
bANKING INITIATIVE
With this special command ability, the force’s leader essentially
concedes the momentum of the battle to his opponent in order
to seize the initiative at a later time . This particular tactic is ideal
for scenarios where the commander’s force is operating on the
defensive, or when it has reserve units waiting for the right moment
to ambush an attacking army To use this command ability, the player acting as the leader
of his particular Force must declare—before any Initiative rolls are
made—that he is yielding the Initiative to his opponent . For the
purposes of any abilities where Initiative margins are considered,
this allows the opposing force to automatically win its Initiative at
a 1-point Margin of Success .
For every two turns (consecutive or otherwise) that the
commander yields the Initiative in this fashion, his force “banks” an
automatic 1-point Initiative success of its own . This banked Initiative
victory can be declared at a later point—once again before any rolls
are made . A maximum of two automatic Initiative successes can
be stored up in this fashion, at the cost of a total of four Initiatives
conceded without a dice roll . If two (or more) players use this ability
to declare banked initiative victory on the same turn, the banked
initiative for those players is still spent, but initiative is determined
as if the ability had not been used by any players .
Banked Initiative successes will not carry over to another
scenario, even if the players are running a continuous campaign;
they can only be used in the current scenario . Unspent successes
that are banked at the time of the scenario’s end are lost .
bERSERKERS
At the start of any turn, a Force with this ability may elect
to go berserk for the rest of the battle . The Force gets a –1 Target
Number modifier for all attacks, but their target movement modifier
is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0 .
bRAWLERS
The diametric opposite of the Sharp Shooters’ emphasis on
long-range fighting is the Brawlers special command ability . A force
that possesses this ability is brutal at short-range, but ill-suited to
long-range sniping . Once again, it is uncommon for an entire force
to possess this ability, so players are advised to limit this option to
no more than one-third of a deployed force (such as a single lance
in a company-sized formation, or a single Star in a Clan Trinary) .
Brawlers replace the normal range modifiers used for their
attacks with the following: Short Range –1; Medium Range +2; Long
Range +5; Extreme Range +10 .
CAMOUfLAGE
Ground Units that are part of a Force with this ability and use
the Stand Still movement option receive a +2 target movement
modifier, in place of the usual +0 . Regardless of the scenario, the
Force may place half its starting Units as Hidden Units (see p . 168),
even if it is the Attacker . The Force may place Hidden Units even in
terrain where ’Mechs cannot usually hide .
COMbAT DROP SPECIALISTS
Units in a Force with this ability always succeed on all Drop
rolls (see Dropping Troops, p . 160) . The Force receives a +2 Initiative
Modifier the turn after making a Combat Drop of at least half
its Units .
COMMUNICATIONS DISRUPTION
The Communications Disruption special command ability
represents a continuous effort by commtech specialists within a
given force to tap into enemy transmissions and scramble or confuse
them . Because this command ability does not require the presence of
elaborate electronics gear, its benefits often vary in the field .
This ability only truly works when the opposing armies are
organized into proper formations, with distinct, pre-assigned sub-
groups (4-unit lances, 5-unit Stars, or 6-unit Level IIs) . If no sub-
groups are identified at the time of gameplay, presume all forces are
using 4-unit lances, and identify which units belong to each lance .
At the beginning of each turn, the player controlling a force
with the Communications Disruption command ability rolls 1D6 .
If the result of this roll is 6, all of the units in one random lance
(or Star, or Level II) of the opposing force is affected by confusing
communications that impairs their ability to coordinate properly .
During the Movement Phase of that turn, the affected sub-group
reduces its available Move by 4 inches (to a minimum of 1 inch) . If
the unit is an aerospace element that uses Thrust Points instead,
reduce its base Thrust by 1 .
The disruptive effects pass by the end of the turn .
Battlefield Intelligence: If the Battlefield Intelligence rules
are in play (see p . 154), a force may only use the Communications
Disruption special command ability if it has a BI ratio of 2:1 (or
higher) over its opponent . If the force’s BI ratio is less than 2:1, the
Communications Disruption special command ability has no effect .
COUNTERPARTS
Some regiments operate in tandem so often that they fare
better together than apart . These unit types should be paired
during Setup in equal numbers . Doing so offers the Counterparts
Force a +1 to Initiative for the entire battle, in addition to other
modifiers and persisting even if all of one unit type is destroyed
or leaves the map . Failing to pair these unit types delivers a –1 to
Initiative for the entire battle .
DIRECT fIRE ARTILLERY
SPECIALISTS
Add 2”/1 hex to the diameter of any Artillery area of effect
when using direct fire .
ENEMY SPECIALIZATION
A force with the Enemy Specialization special command
ability has one enemy faction or group that it favors fighting
above all others, and makes a point to train heavily in dealing
with the common tactics and equipment found among that
particular enemy . Before game play begins, the specific focus of this
specialization must be identified . This can be either an entire faction
(e .g . a specific Great House, a specific Clan, or a specific Periphery
state), or a particular group (e .g . the Davion Heavy Guards or the
Wolf’s Dragoons) .
As with the environmental and tactical specializations
described earlier, the benefits and drawbacks of enemy
specialization increase with the force’s average Skill Rating . This is
defined by adding the Skill Ratings of all units in the force, dividing
the sum by the number of units, and rounding the result normally
to the nearest whole . Then consult page 29 for a definition of these
Skill Ratings .
A force rated Green, Very Green, or Wet Behind the Ears
receives no benefits from enemy specialization, but will still suffer
the –1 Initiative modifier if the focus of its specialization does not
apply to the scenario (reflecting the force’s training focus on honing
its skills to one particular tactical area) . If the force is rated Regular,
it will receive a +1 Initiative modifier when facing its selected
enemy, but will suffer a –1 Initiative modifier when facing any other
opposing force . If the force is rated Veteran, it may either double the modifier for facing its selected enemy (while also doubling the
negative modifier for opponents of other affiliations), or it may select
a second preferred enemy to apply the same modifiers with . If the
latter option is chosen, the negative modifiers will not stack, so the
specialized force will receive a +1 Initiative modifier when facing its
two chosen enemies, but will only suffer a –1 Initiative roll modifier
against all other forces .
If the force is rated Elite, in addition to the Initiative modifiers
described above, it may add the ability to negate one of its preferred
enemy force’s special command abilities (if any, chosen at the time of
the scenario) . If the force is rated Heroic or Legendary, it may negate
two of the preferred enemy force’s special command abilities, or
add a special command ability to itself that only “activates” when
facing its enemy of choice . Under these rules, a force cannot negate
command abilities possessed by enemies it has not specialized itself
to fight .
ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIZATION
A force with this special command ability has mastered or
prefers combat in certain, specific types of terrain or environments .
Before game play begins, the specific nature of this environmental
specialization must be identified . The terrain types chosen for
this specialization may be any type, and any other environmental
conditions (including atmospheric density, darkness, gravity, and
other conditions described on p . 61) must be of a non-standard
nature (e .g . vacuum, night, high gravity, and so on) .
Once the specific terrain and/or environment is determined,
the player must then choose a number of rules that apply from the
Environmental Specialist Benefits List, based on the entire force’s
average Skill Rating . This average is determined by adding together
all of the units’ Skill Ratings, dividing that sum by the number of units
in the force, and rounding the result normally to the nearest whole
number . Consult page 29 for a definition of these Skill Ratings .
If the force’s average Skill Rating of all units in the force is
Green, Very Green, or Wet Behind the Ears, it may not receive any
benefits for environmental specialization, but will still suffer the –1
Initiative modifier if the focus of its specialization does not apply to
the scenario (reflecting the force’s training focus on honing its skills
to one particular tactical area) . If its average Skill Rating is Regular,
it receives one of the listed benefits . If the average Skill Rating is
Veteran or Elite, two different benefits may be applied . If the average
Skill Rating is Heroic or Legendary, a third different benefit may be
applied, or one of the two benefits received may be applied twice .
In addition to applying any benefits for environmental
specialization, a force with this command ability will also suffer a
–1 Initiative modifier when forced to play in a scenario where the
environmental condition they are specialized for is not present .
Clear: The bonuses for this Special Command Ability work
differently than the other Environmental Specializations (see below) .
Desert: This specialization includes Sand, Rough, and Rubble
terrain, as well as Winds of Wind Force 3+, Blowing Sand, and Hot
Temperature environmental conditions .
Urban: This specialization includes any pavement, building, or
bridge terrain . If this Force chooses the Improved Combat option,
attacks from this force halve the Damage Absorption of any buildings
(round up) .
Vacuum: This specialization includes Trace Atmosphere .
Winter: This specialization includes Snow, Ice, and Tundra
terrain areas, as well as any Cold environment conditions .
Woods: This specialization includes Woods (as well as different
levels of Woods: Light Woods, Heavy Woods, Ultra-Heavy Woods) and
Jungle (and the different levels of Jungle) .
ESPRIT DE CORPS
A Force with this ability is never subject to Forced Withdrawal
or Morale checks 
fALSE fLAG
This Force must also have the Off-Map Movement Command
Ability . It may designate up to one-third of its Units in a scenario as
operating under a False Flag . These designated Units are kept off-
map until they enter the map on the third turn or later . On the turn
the controlling player declares the False Flag Units are entering the
map, before initiative is rolled, roll 2D6 . On an 8+, the Unit has not
been discovered as false, and may enter on any map edge, including
the opposing player’s home edge .
In addition, the controlling player receives +2 to their Initiative
rolls on the turn the False Flag Forces enter the map . On a 7 or less,
the ruse was discovered and the Units must enter from an edge on
the half of the map containing their home edge .
fAST WITHDRAWAL
Units in the force may exit via any edge of the map (save
the opponent’s home edge) at any time, including during Forced
Withdrawal, without being considered destroyed or captured,
regardless of rules for the scenario .
fLANKERS
When a scenario calls for the Force’s Units to enter via a map
edge, the Units may enter via any non-home map edge instead .
fOCUS
(SPECIAL PILOT AbILITY NAME)
During setup, the Force may assign one Unit out of every
four (round down) the Special Pilot Ability listed in parenthesis .
This Special Command Ability may be taken a second time to give
twice the number of SPAs, but only one SPA can be given by this
Special Command Ability per Unit . If the Combat Command has
two different SPA Command Abilities, it cannot give both SPAs to
the same unit .
fORCING THE INITIATIVE
Forcing the Initiative is a command ability often favored during
offensive missions . It relies on aggressive tactics and rapid assaults
that combine to provoke fear and hesitation in an enemy through
sheer, brute force .
With this ability, the commanding player applies a modifier to
his Initiative roll equal to the number of opposing units his force
destroyed in the previous turn, minus the number of its own units
lost to the enemy . For example, if a force with this ability destroyed
6 enemy ’Mechs in the previous turn, but lost 3 of its own, the
Initiative modifier would equal +3 (6 – 3 = 3) . Only the kills made
during the previous turn may be applied toward this Initiative
modifier; kills and losses made two or more turns in the past will
not apply .
As with Banking the Initiative, using this ability requires the
commanding player to declare his intent to do so before the dice
are rolled for Initiative . This ability cannot be used in the first turn
of any scenario .
GROUND ATTACK SPECIALISTS
The Ground Attack Specialists special command ability is
available only to aerospace units or other units that use airborne
movement (including VTOLs and WiGE ground vehicles) . The
opposite of Anti-Aircraft Specialists, these units have honed their
skills to deliver more effective attacks against ground-based
opponents . Once again, it is uncommon for an entire aerospace
force to possess this ability, so players are advised to limit this
capability to a pre-determined portion of their deployed aerospace
forces .
Ground Attack Specialists receive a –2 Target Number modifier
to all attacks made against ground-based targets, including units
that use jumping movement, and air-capable units that are landed
at the time of the attack . Against airborne aerospace units, including
ground units with the VTOL (v) or WiGE (g) movement types, this
Target Number modifier becomes +1 instead .
Ground units incapable of VTOL, WiGE, or aerospace movement
(Thrust), may not make use of the Ground Attack Specialists
command ability .
HIGHLANDER bURIAL
The Units in a Force with this ability receive a –1 Target Number
Modifier and deal an additional point of damage when making
Death From Above attacks .
HIT AND RUN
At the start of any turn that a Force with the Hit and Run ability
is outnumbered, its Units can ignore the Attacker Movement Modifier
for jumping, or receive a −1 Attacker Movement Modifier if not
standing still or immobile .
INfANTRY DEfENSIVE EXPERTS
Infantry units may be considered Hidden (even when scenario
rules do not expressly call for such) and in prepared positions .
Consider these to be Light buildings (CF 2) that do not require
placement on the map and are gone once the unit moves .
INfANTRY DRAGOONS
Mounted infantry may move their full movement, instead of
half, after dismounting .
INfILTRATORS
When fighting as the Attacker, these commands are able to
sneak forces close to (or into) the Defender's deployment zone before
the battle begins . Before the Defender places units, the Infiltrating
units are deployed as Hidden units in the Defender’s deployment
zone or if the Defender enters via their home edge, the Infiltrating
units must deploy within 4” of the Defender’s home edge . The type
of units depends on how many times this Special Command Ability
is chosen .
1: Infantry and light (Size 1) Vehicles (Combat or Support)
2: +medium (Size 2) vehicles and light (Size 1) ’Mechs
3: +heavy (Size 3) vehicles and medium (Size 2) ’Mechs
If using the Master Unit List (see p . 110) or other faction
availability lists for force building, the Infiltrating units should be
among those available to the Defender’s force . For example, a
Davion force infiltrating a Kurita force may use units from the General
Availability List or the Kurita Availability List .
IN THE MOMENT
Immediately after the opponent sets up their forces, this force
may select one of its available Special Command Abilities in place
of In the Moment . If the force chooses to make this swap, it has a −1
Initiative modifier for the first two turns .
INTELLIGENCE SPECIALISTS
The Force can add the MHQ5 special ability to one Unit in
its force .
LOPPERS
If the unit declares a MEL attack instead of making any weapon
attacks, a successful hit inflicts 1 extra point of damage and allows
one additional Critical Hit roll (even if there is armor remaining) . Note:
after such a hit, roll 1D6 . On a result of 6, the hatchet has broken
and the ’Mech loses the MEL special ability for the rest of the battle .
Off-MAP MOVEMENT
The Off-Map Movement special command ability represents
a force’s superior flanking tactics . This ability cannot be used in a
scenario type that would specifically violate its rules, such as by an
attacking force in a Breakthrough scenario, or by a defending force
in a Hold-the-Line scenario .
Each unit that uses this ability must designate an exit
point on the map edge that the unit will leave from, along with
a corresponding reentry point that it will return from . These
designated points must be written down in advance of the actual
maneuver, even if only in the turn the unit actually begins its off-
map movement . Along with these points must also be noted the
minimum number of turns the off-map units must remain off the
map before reentering . To find this minimum Off-Map Movement
time, determine the total distance traveled between the exit and
reentry points along the outer edges of the map that correspond to
the off-map units’ positions . Then, divide this travel distance by the
unit’s Move value, rounding up to the nearest whole number . For
example, if a unit with a Move of 6” per turn uses Off-Map Movement
by leaving the western edge of the map, with a designated reentry
point 19 inches farther north along the same edge, the controlling
player measures 19 inches along the west edge, divides that result
by 6 (the unit’s Move), and finds that the unit must spend at least
4 turns off the map to do this (19 ÷ 6 = 3 .167, round up to 4) . Units
using Off-Map Movement may remain off the map for longer than
the minimum number of turns, at the controlling player’s discretion .
The player whose units are making use of Off-Map Movement
need not inform his opponent of these exit and reentry points, or
the minimum turns each unit must remain off the map, until the
unit returns . At this point, the written orders may be reviewed by
the opposing player, to ensure that the movement made was a legal
off-map move . If a unit attempts to return earlier than its minimum
number of off-map turns, or returns in a different position than its
designated reentry, the move may be considered illegal, and the unit
is considered destroyed for gameplay purposes . (As a special excuse
to this condition, a returning unit may arrive at or after its minimum
number of turns in a position adjacent to its predetermined reentry
point, but only if the destination position is presently occupied by
another unit at the time of arrival .)
Units using Off-Map Movement are placed on the edge of the
map at their designated reentry point during the End Phase of their turn of arrival . If unfriendly units find themselves in base contact or
within 1 inch of a unit returning to the map via Off-Map Movement,
those hostile units may attack the returning unit as per the rules for
Surprise Attacks by Hidden Units (see p . 168) .
Units using Off-Map Movement are not counted toward a
given side’s force for Initiative purposes while they are off the map .
If all on-map forces for a given side are destroyed or retreat while
that side still has units moving off the map in this fashion, those
off-map forces are considered withdrawn and the scenario ends .
OVERRUN COMbAT
Overrun Combat is another example of aggressive tactics in
action . Unlike Forcing the Initiative, this special command ability
is less about capitalizing on the relative amount of damage done
to an enemy force, and more about taking advantage of even the
slightest hesitation among its ranks .
Overrun Combat works any time a force with this ability wins
an Initiative roll by a margin of 2 points or more . When this occurs,
the player divides the number of points by which he has won the
Initiative roll by 2, rounding all results down (to a minimum of 0) .
This becomes the number of units the player may move and attack
with before any other units can act in the current turn . The damage
effects of attacks from Overrun Combat are resolved immediately .
For the purposes of the rest of the turn’s actions, the
overrunning units fall outside of the normal sequence, leaving
the remaining units to alternate according to how many units the
overrunning force has left to move after its other units have already
acted . For example, if a 12-unit force has the Overrun Combat ability
and wins its Initiative roll by 5, two of its units can move and attack
before any of the opposing force even have the chance to move (5
÷ 2 = 2 .5, round down to 2) . After these units have acted, the rest of
the turn is resolved as if the overrun-capable force has only 10 units
left to alternate with its opponent under the normal turn sequence .
The benefits of Overrun Combat apply on a turn-by-turn basis .
This means that even if the Initiative roll success is so high that the
number of overrunning units is would actually be more than the force
actually has, those “extra” units will not carry over to the next turn .
RAPID STRIKE
In any scenario in which a Force with this ability is the Attacker,
its Units move onto the map as normal, but only half of the opposing
Force may deploy at the start of the game or on the first turn . The
remaining enemy Units are divided into two equal-sized groups that
move onto the map from their home edge on Turns 2 and 3 . The
group moving onto the map is chosen at random . The controlling
player chooses the specific Units that do not deploy in the first turn,
as well as the composition of the two undeployed groups .
REGIONAL SPECIALIZATION
A Force with the Regional Specialization ability has one region
in which it favors fighting above all others . This region may be a
single system (Bad News) or a larger political division (Duchy,
Prefecture, Military District, etc) .
If fighting in its preferred Region, the Force receives a +1
Initiative modifier and a –1 Morale modifier to Morale Checks . This
Special Command Ability may be taken twice, doubling the modifiers
for Initiative and Morale Checks when in the preferred region .
SAVAGES
All Units get the Blood Stalker SPA . No enemy Unit may be
targeted by the Blood Stalker ability by more than one Unit in the
force with Savages . If there are not enough enemy Units to target,
the remaining Savages Units suffer the penalty for attacking any
enemy Unit . When a Unit without a Blood Stalker target activates,
and there is an enemy no longer targeted by a Blood Stalker ability,
that Unit may then declare a target for its Blood Stalker SPA .
SHARP SHOOTERS
A force that possesses the Sharp Shooters special command
ability is especially adept at long-ranged attacks, but at a cost in
short-range accuracy . It is uncommon for an entire force to possess
this special command ability, so players are advised to limit this
option to no more than one-third of a deployed force (such as a
single lance in a company-sized formation, or a single Star in a Clan
Trinary) .
Sharp Shooters replace the normal range modifiers used for
their attacks with the following: Short Range +1; Medium Range
+2; Long Range +3; Extreme Range +4 .
SHIELDING
Any opposing Unit must fire on a ’Mech before targeting a
vehicle or infantry Unit, as long as the ’Mech is closer and in LOS .
SPEED fIRE
When using their full Move in a direct line away from their
starting location, units receive a −1 Target Number modifier .
STRATEGIC COMMAND
The Force may alter the choices of home edge, and move any
terrain up to 6” from its Setup position . If using mapsheets instead
of terrain, the Force may rearrange the mapsheets, as long as the
final arrangement has the same overall final shape . For example, if
the Setup has two mapsheets aligned with long edges touching,
after rearranging the mapsheets, there must still be two mapsheets
aligned with long edges touching . However, which mapsheet goes
where and which edge face which direction may be changed .
STRATEGIC PLANNING
This force receives a +2 bonus to Initiative . This SCA is only
available to Forces with an average Experience Rating of Veteran,
Elite, Heroic, or Legendary .
TACTICAL ADJUSTMENTS
After turn 3, the opposing Force does not gain any bonuses to
their Initiative rolls from Command Abilities or Special Pilot Abilities .
TACTICAL EXPERTS (COMbINED fIRE)
If an entire Formation of three or more Units attacks the same
opposing Unit, their attacks gain a –1 Target Number modifier .
TACTICAL EXPERTS (DOGfIGHTING)
A force with this ability gives a –2 penalty to enemy units
making Control Rolls for forming and avoiding engagements .
TACTICAL EXPERTS (ENGINEERS)
During setup, this controlling player of the Force with this ability
may place light buildings or minefields on the table during setup .
The Engineers can place one light building (2” diameter or 1 hex) or
five points of minefield density in 1-5 minefields per Formation with
4 or more units . The buildings and minefields must be placed on the
Engineers’ half of the play area .
TACTICAL EXPERTS (HIDDEN UNITS)
In any scenario that allows Hidden Units, a Force with this ability
may place twice as many Hidden Units (to a maximum of 4 extra
Units) . If the scenario does not provide for Hidden Units, this force
may place up to four Hidden Units on their half of the map, at least
12” away from any enemy Units .
TACTICAL EXPERTS (PHYSICAL)
The controlling player of a Force with this ability may choose
to have all its Units receive a +1 Target Number modifier for weapon
attacks in order to receive a −1 Target Number modifier for physical
and melee attacks . This choice is made in the Combat Phase each
turn, before making any attacks .
TACTICAL EXPERTS (SIEGE)
Units in the command with this Special Command Ability
reduce the Damage Absorption rating of buildings by half (round
the reduced value down) . A non-infantry target in a light building
would have a 0 Damage Absorption against an attacker using this
Special Command Ability .
TACTICAL SPECIALIZATION
A force with this special command ability has mastered or
prefers combat under certain, specific mission parameters, with predefined roles and options . Before game play begins, the specific
nature of this tactical specialization must be identified . This can be
either a preference for attacking over defense (and vice versa), or a
preference for specific scenario types .
As with environmental specialization, the specific nature and
extent of these specializations is limited by the force’s average Skill
Rating (determined by adding up the Skill Ratings for all of the units
in the force, then dividing by the number of units in the force, and
rounding that result normally to the nearest whole number) . (See p .
29 for a definition of these Skill Ratings .)
If the force’s average Skill Rating of all units in the force is Green,
Very Green, or Wet Behind the Ears, it may not select any benefits for
tactical specialization, but will still suffer the –1 Initiative modifier
if the focus of its specialization does not apply to the scenario
(reflecting the force’s training focus on honing its skills to one
particular tactical area) . If its average Skill Rating is Regular, it may
select only one of the benefits listed under the Tactical Specialist
Benefits List . If the average Skill Rating is Veteran or Elite, two benefits
may be applied . If the average Skill Rating is Heroic or Legendary, a
third different benefit may be applied, or one of the two benefits
received may be applied twice .
Note that the Attack and Defense specialization benefits may
both be taken at the same time but their presence will cancel
each other when taken together . This effect, however, only
occurs when the two are of equal levels . If a force selects Attack
Specialization benefits twice, and Defense Specialization benefits
once . The result will be the equivalent of taking one “level” of
Attack Specialization .
TACTICAL SPECIALIZATION
(COMbINED ARMS)
If the Force contains at least one of each ground Unit type
(‘Mech, vehicle, and infantry), the force has a +1 modifier to
Initiative . This SCA can be taken a second time to grant the
qualifying force the effects of the Tactical Experts (Attack or
Defense, choose one) SCA .
TACTICAL SPECIALIZATION
(SMALL UNIT ACTIONS)
This command prefers small unit actions . It receives a +2
Initiative Modifier if the total friendly Force is less than 12 units . It
receives a +1 Initiative Bonus if the total friendly Force is less than
24 units . It receives a −1 Initiative penalty if the total friendly force
is 24 or more units .
WARRIOR CODE
These Forces prefer personal duels . Forces with this Command
Ability can designate one Unit per legal Formation (consisting of
3 or more Units and meeting the Formation requirements for its
Formation Type) as a Champion . The Champion receives the Blood
Stalker Special Pilot Ability . The chosen enemy must be of the same
Size class or larger . If a Champion is destroyed by the chosen enemy
of the Blood Stalker ability (all the damage to the Champion must
come from the chosen enemy), the Warrior Code Force receives a
–1 Initiative modifier . If a Champion destroys the chosen enemy (all
the damage to the chosen enemy coming from the Champion), the
Warrior Code force receives a +1 Initiative modifier . The Initiative
modifier only applies to the first chosen enemy of each Champion,
but are stackable from multiple Champions defeating or being
defeated by their chosen enemy .
ZONE Of CONTROL
A force that possesses the Zone of Control special command
ability can effectively discourage an enemy’s movement in close
quarters, forcing their opponents to either fall back or otherwise
swing wide around its positions . This tactic is good for both
defensive and offensive operations, particularly when the force has numbers or terrain on its side, but is only useful when the units
involved are using ground-based movement .
To exert a Zone of Control, the unit must end its Move in base
contact with one or more opponents, and have at least 2 inches of
unused Move when it does so . The opposing units it comes into
base contact with in this fashion must be in the unit’s forward
firing arc (see p . 41), and will be affected only if they have not
already moved at this point in the turn, or if they attempt to move
through this area within less than 2 inches of the zone-controlling
unit . Any opponents that meet these criteria fall under the unit’s
“zone of control .”
Units within another unit’s “zone of control” must spend an
additional 4 inches of Move to proceed in any direction other
than directly away from the zone-controlling unit, unless they are
using Jumping or VTOL movement to do so . If this would reduce
the affected unit’s Move to less than 1 inch, the unit cannot move
unless it proceeds directly away from the zone-controlling unit .
For the purposes of this rule, “directly away” is considered the
direction opposite any facing that would directly contact the zone-
controlling unit’s base .
If the zone-controlling unit is infantry (including battle armor),
it may only exert a zone of control over other infantry unit types .



Here some details about TACTICAL SPECIALIZATION, ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIZATION and ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIZATION (CLEAR):
-----------------------------
TACTICAL SPECIALIZATION BENEFITS LIST (Benefit and Rules)
- Attack Specialization
The force receives a +1 Initiative roll modifier when acting as the Attacker in a scenario of any type, but
suffers a –1 Initiative roll modifier when acting as the Defender .
- Defense Specialization
The force receives a +1 Initiative roll modifier when acting as the Defender in a scenario of any type, but
suffers a –1 Initiative roll modifier when acting as the Attacker .
